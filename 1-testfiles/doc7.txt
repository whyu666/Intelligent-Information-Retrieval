Public concerns should be actively addressed with continuous release of information, they said at the meeting.

They also urged efforts to launch special safety overhauls of civil aviation and all other key sectors in the country to ward off major and severe safety accidents.

China Eastern Airlines flight MU5735 was en route from southwestern city of Kunming to southern city of Guangzhou, with 132 people on board when air controllers lost contact with the plane Monday afternoon. It was later found crashed in a mountainous area of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region less than an hour before the scheduled landing time.

As of Tuesday evening, no survivors had been found, Zhu Tao, director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters in a press conference. No black boxes have been found, and the cause of the crash is under investigation.
